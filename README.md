# Applets

We provide here several applets for a pedagogical purpose. The applets aim at giving an intuition of a statistical method by focusing on its main principle. Thus, they often consider simplified situations, contrarily to the courses of Wikistat, which go deeper into details, or to the notebooks on real case studies.

We hope that they will be a good complementary tool for learning. 
You can run directly the applets on the web:

* [Principal component analysis](https://roustant.shinyapps.io/pca-app/)
* [Linear discriminant analysis](https://roustant.shinyapps.io/fda-app/)

You can also run them locally, using the R package shiny. Then use the notebook wikistatsApp.ipynb 

Play and enjoy!
